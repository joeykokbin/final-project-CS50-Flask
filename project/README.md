Project: Flask-cs50-implementation

===============================================================================
Welcome to piece of cake! This website aims to satiate all your desire for cake.
You can sign up as a user, post or browse cakes already available for sale!

You can even view how many cakes you have bought!
===============================================================================

This is an implementation based on Python's Flask, together with deployment on Heroku platform.
The database uses Heroku's native postgresql and its underlying URL.

On the landing page, customers can view a gallery of the best cakes chosen by our editors.
Customers can also view a special list of curated recipe videos of delicious bakes, courtesy of Bon Appetit channel on youtube.

Customers can freely register their accounts and depending on their usertype (buyers and sellers), they can post and buy cakes on sale!

Each cake allows 3 pictures for the customer to browse, and each cake comes with a $5 delivery charge, or self-collection at no cost.

Products chosen will be stored in the user's cart, and can be removed if the user chooses to.
All in all, this website behaves like a normal online bakery, allowing you to view and purchase cakes.

For any queries, please feel free to email me through the 'About' button that's available on each page.
